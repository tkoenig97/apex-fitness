                Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) is the amount of energy or calories
                that your body needs to maintain basic bodily functions while at
                rest. It represents the minimum number of calories required to
                keep your body functioning, including processes like breathing,
                circulating blood, regulating body temperature, and supporting
                cell production. 
                
                BMR is influenced by various factors, including
                age, gender, height, weight, and body composition. 
                By calculating and considering your BMR, you gain insights into your body's
                unique energy needs, enabling you to make informed choices about
                diet, exercise, and overall well-being. 
                
                Remember, while BMR provides valuable information, it is just one piece of the
                puzzle. Consulting with healthcare professionals or registered
                dietitians can offer personalized guidance based on your
                specific goals and needs. 
                
                Please note that BMR calculations are
                estimates, and individual variations exist.
